        <p id="goals-intro">These are the goals I have set for myself.
             I plan on accomplishing these goals and add plenty more as I go on with life.
             They will be given the season and year of which they were achieved to make it easier to read.
             These goals are programming, traveling, and tricking goals respectively. <br> <br> 
             I'd like to accomplish many things, and I hope this list can help me realize how much 
             I have accoplished and how much more I can possibly do in the future.
